# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This is a the readme.md for my final project.  I am studying post operative indicators for AKI in patients who underwent
cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB) with del Nido cardioplegia and who had hemoconcentration used in their cases.  I have three data sets.  
The first is the Society of Thorasic Surgeons, the second CPB data from Quantum Perufsion EMR and the third; data from PennChart.
